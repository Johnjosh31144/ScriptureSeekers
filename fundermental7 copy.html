            <p>Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think and do. Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind and spirit dependent upon God for life and breath and all else. When
                our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and fell from their high position under God. The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. But God sent Jesus to die, to reconcile and restore
                man into the image of their maker .

            When we look at the choices we make in life, even the small daily choices, it’s easy to feel like we’re an untidy mix of contradictions.  We can spend the whole day at a job where we help others, then come home and snap at a family member for no particular
            reason. We can try our hardest to be kind and patient with someone we love, only to say something harsh to them at the worst possible moment. We are capable of great empathy and selflessness—and we are also capable of cruelty, hatred, and
            insensitivity. <br> <b>Why are we like this?</b> <br> <b>Were we always like this? </b> <br> <b>Will we forever be like this?</b> <br> In the next two lessons, we will look to the Bible to tell us who we are. The Bible will give
            us the whole story of where we came from, and why we are the way we are. <br> <br> <br> <br>

            <span class="cha">We’ll unpack from the Bible about:</span> <br> Man’s or Humanity’s origin <br> What it means to be created in God’s image <br> How humanity lost their perfection, severing their connection to God <br> How that loss of connection
            impacts every part of our lives <br> God’s plan to redeem us and repair the relationship we once had with Him <br>

            <span class="verse">Gen 2:7</span> <br> Man has an exalted position in relation to all other creation. God made him in charge of Planet Earth and all animal life.
            <span class="verse">Gen 1:28; Ps.8:4-9 (Powerful!) </span> <br> The human race is united as we all came out of the hand of God.

            <span class="verse">Gen.2:7; Job 33:4 (Wow!)</span> <br> So, the dust of the ground + the breath of life = living being or living soul.

            <br> How did such a radical and terrible transformation come about? <br> If God created a perfect world, how could sin develop? <br> God and the origin of sin – Is God the Creator also the author of sin? <br>
            <span class="verse">Isa.6:3; Deut.32:4; Job 34:10;</span> God hates sin <span class="verse">Ps. 5:4; 11:5.</span> <br> If God is not the author of sin, who then is its author? <br> God created beings with the power of choice. One of His created
