        <h1>FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF 8: <br> The great controversy <br><br><br>

            <p>All humanity is involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice,
                in self-exaltation became Satan, God’s adversary, and led into rebellion a third of the angels. He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. As a result our world became so mixed up! Each of
                us is engaged in the epic battle between good and evil. But praise God in the end, good will prevail and evil will be destroyed. Amen!
            </p>

    <section id="skills" class="center">
        <p>
            <span class="cha">What is the Great Controversy?</span> <br> It is not a physical battle. It is a spiritual battle, a conflict over God’s character, His authority or right to rule the universe.

            <span class="verse">Eph.6:12 </span>
            <span class="cha"> Where and by whom did the great controversy begin?</span> <br> But the war didn’t begin on earth – it began in Heaven before the earth even existed, by an angel named Lucifer.
            <span class="verse">Isaiah 14:12 </span> <br>
            <span class="cha">The Great Controversy Begins With War In Heaven
</span> <br>
            <img src="images/image23.png" alt="" style="float: right; width: 30%;"> <span class="cha">Who was Lucifer?</span> <br> He was a splendid being, wise and beautiful, one of God’s perfect creations. He was the great commander of the angelic host.
            <span class="verse">Ezekiel 28:12-15</span> <br>
            <span class="cha">What went wrong?</span> <br> Lucifer grew proud because of his beauty, his wisdom was corrupted with his splendor – he considered himself equal with God.
            <span class="verse">Isaiah 14:13-14 </span> <br>
            <span class="cha">Then what happened next?</span> <br> Lucifer incited a rebellion, trying to turn the angels of Heaven against their creator. He falsely accused God’s character, spreading lies among the angels and calling God an unjust ruler.
            And some of the angels believed him. They sided, with Lucifer, choosing him as their new leader, and rose up in rebellion against God.
            <span class="verse">Revelation 12:7-9</span> <br>

            <span class="cha"> How did Lucifer become Satan?</span> <br> Lucifer, once a trusted angel at God’s side, betrayed his king, started a rebellion, and was kicked out of heaven with his followers. On that day he became Satan the deceiver. And
            that is when all earth’s troubles began.
            <span class="verse">Revelation 12:10</span> <br>

    <section id="skills" class="center">
        <p>

            <span class="cha">How did the great controversy come to the earth? </span>
            <br> When Satan was banished from Heaven he headed straight for Earth, accompanied by all the angels who followed him. He knew he was no match for God, so he cooked up a plan to get revenge. He wanted to cause God the most pain he could—by
            corrupting God’s new creations (Adam and Eve).
            <span class="verse">Gen 2:17; 3:1-5</span>
            <span class="cha">How did the great controversy come to the earth? 
</span>
            <img src="images/image24.png" alt="" style="float: right; width: 30%;"> Satan employed the same trick he had used to deceive the angels in Heaven, casting doubt on God’s character, calling Him a liar and claiming that God was just trying to
            keep all the power for Himself. Satan essentially told Eve that she didn’t need God. Both Even and Adam ate from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Eve. And with that, humanity took the side of rebellion against God and was dragged into
            the great controversy between good and evil.
            <br>

            <span class="cha">Sadly, Eve and Adam ate fell for Satan’s lie.
</span> <br>
            <img src="images/image25.png" alt="" style="float: left; width: 30%;"> <span class="cha">Who can get us out of this war?</span> <br> We cannot regain our once-perfect nature on our own. Only through God’s help are we able to choose His Way.
            <span class="verse"> Romans 5:12-21</span>
            <img src="images/image26.png" alt="" style="float: right; width: 30%;"> <br>
            <span class="cha">How do we fight in this battle?</span> <br> Each of us must make daily decisions on whose side we choose. The entire universe has its eyes on Earth, watching the choices we make. <span class="verse">1 Cor 4:9</span> . This
            is the reason God allowed Satan to live, why He allows sin exist and spread across our world. It would have been easy for God to destroy Satan and his angels in an instant. But if God did that, the angels who remained would follow Him out
            of fear, and not out of choice.

            <span class="cha">So what do during this great controversy on earth and within our hearts?</span> <br> We know we cannot win this battle on own, but by holding onto Christ’s promises, we will be saved.
            <span class="verse">Mathew 24:13</span> <br> Let us look at some of the many promises and pieces of advice God has given us in the Bible:
            <span class="verse">Mathew 26:41; James 4:7-8; <br>
Mathew 11:28-30; Josh 15:5; <br>
John 3:16;17; 1 Thess. 5:16-18; 1 John 1:9 </span> <br>
            <span class="cha">Who will be ultimate winner in the great controversy? 

 
</span> <br> God has the ultimate victory – He has told us how it will all end. Satan and everyone he’s deceived will one day be wiped out and the world will be made new.
            <span class="verse">Revelation 20</span> <br> One day, God promises us He will put an end to sin, destroy Satan and his followers and make all things right and new again. But before that happens, everyone has to make a choice. They can serve
            God, accepting His free gift of salvation and choosing to live by His commandments, or choose the path of rebellion following Satan, and eventually sharing his fate.
            <br>
            <span class="cha">Why is the war taking so long to end?</span> <br> Scripture has already made it clear how this great war for Earth is going to end. God will one day be victorious, conquering sin once and for all. He will set up a new kingdom
            on earth, a kingdom that will never die. God wants each and every one of us to be there with Him. He is patient with us
            <span class="verse">2 Peter 3:10</span>
            <br>
            <span class="cha">God’s Ultimate Victory</span> <br> The entire universe has its eyes on Earth, waiting to see how this war plays out. Will God’s good and just character finally be vindicated? Fortunately, we already know how this war is going
            to end. God told us Himself in the book of Revelation, explaining how Satan and everyone he’s deceived will one day be wiped out and the  <span><a style="color: rgb(43, 46, 194);" href="https://www.adventist.org/the-new-earth/">world will be made new</a></span>(
            <span class="verse">Revelation 20</span>).
            <br>One day, God promises us He will put an end to sin, destroy Satan and his followers, and make all things right again. But before that happens, everyone has to make a choice.  Everyone on Earth must take a side in this spiritual war, this
            Great Controversy. They must look at the world around them, see the terrible results sin has brought, and choose whom they will serve.

            a kingdom that will never die. God wants each and every one of us to be there with Him. He is patient with us, “not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance”
            <span class="verse">(2 Peter 3:10, ESV).</span> <br> But ultimately, the choice is ours. It’s up to us whose side we take in the great Controversy over God’s character. <br> We can choose the path of rebellion and selfishness, which is made
            to look appealing to the flesh, but it leads to destruction. Or, even though this world makes it difficult, we can choose the path of justice, mercy, and God’s unfailing love.
            <span class="verse">I choose God and His love? <br> What about you? </span>
